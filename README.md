# rock-paper-scissors

Rock Paper Scissors is a project from the Odin Project where the objective is to create a rock scissors game by prompting the user to type in either "rock", "paper", or "scissors." 

Then, the computer will randomly choose one of the three items, as well. The game continues for 5 rounds.
